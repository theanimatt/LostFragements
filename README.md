Game Story
In the distant galaxy of Kindan, a young adventurer named Lumina discovers an ancient artifact known as the Starlight Crystal. Legend has it that this crystal holds the power to restore balance to the universe, but it was shattered into pieces and scattered across KIndan by an evil force. 

Lumina, chosen by the crystal, embarks on a quest to collect its fragments and save Kindan from impending darkness. Along the way, she encounters various challenges  and enemies who are trying to prevent her from restoring the crystal. 

The first location where the first piece of the crystal is found is a mystical planet, Astralina, famous for its purple colouring. The way to the crystal is not too complicated, but it is dangerous because of poisonous spikes 

Then the next planet she goes to is the terribly hot vulcan planet, Magmara. Because of the hot lava, she has to be very careful on the thin rocks to get to the second crystal piece. The adventure then continues on the green planet, Leafaria, with its beautiful natural bounty. This planet is famous for its beautiful and unique plants, such as the Aetherial Veilvine or the Snake Fang with its special venom. 

After the three special locations, Lumina is curious to see what the final location will be, and will be very surprised to find out that the last piece of the crystal is nowhere else but on her home planet, Lunaria. At first horrified by this, knowing the cruel conditions of the planet, but then remembering that he is the chosen one to restore peace to Kindan, she regains his strength and sets out on the cruel journey.
